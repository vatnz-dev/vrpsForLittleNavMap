# Visual Reporting Points for LittleNavMap

This is the release and development repository for the Visual Reporting Points for LittleNavMap resource, made available by the VATNZ Operations Department.

## What's LittleNavMap?

[LittleNavMap](https://albar965.github.io/littlenavmap.html) is a free and open source flight planner, navigation tool, moving map and airport/procedure information system designed for use with FSX, MFS2020, P3D and X-Plane. 

Coupled with a [Navigraph](https://navigraph.com) subscription, LittleNavMap allows enthusiasts to visualize the procedures and airspace around them. 

## What benefits do these VRPs provide?

Visual Reporting Points are fixed reporting points scattered around the country for use in VFR position reports. These VRPs are not found in online airspace maps, such as the AIP or Navigraph. Having these in your LittleNavMap enables you to see the VRPs around you, and reference them in your radio calls and VFR procedures.

## How do I install these?

In the top bar of LittleNavMap, navigate to `Userpoints > Import CSV`. From there you want to find the downloaded file and click Open. The userpoints will be now be available within the 'Userpoints' window.

## Data Information

The VRP data is sourced from the Air Navigation Register - a registry of all aeronautical information, as released by Aeropath and the Civil Aviation Authority. The ANR is updated every 56 days in line with a two-month AIRAC cycle. 

The VATNZ VRP for LittleNavMap data is updated and released every six months, or whenever a major change in VRPs has occurred. 

The Manager for this project is the Operations Director, who can be contacted through the VATNZ Discord, or operations(at)vatnz.net.
